## Version bumps

As much as I love version bump pull requests, they really do not provide any value
since I have to make a release manually anyways. And let's be honest, it's a matter
of just changing a version number. So please, instead of making these as pull
requests, just ask through an [issue](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/issues).

## Worthwhile contributions

* Things that are explicitly broken and fixed are always welcome
* Code that is worthwhile to everyone in [files](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/tree/master/files)
